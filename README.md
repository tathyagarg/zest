# Zest 
A programming language for the Z3D game engine.
Zest is specially built for usage with the game engine, and it's syntax and implementation reflect that development choice.
It compiles from a language where it's extremely easy to programmaticaly create scenes to Z3D compatible Zig code.

## Note
This project is still in development, and currently serves as more of a configuration file than as a programming language
